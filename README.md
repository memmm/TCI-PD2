## Authors

* **Emese Engedi** - *Based on the book Tomek Katzanowski - Practical Unit Testing with JUnit and Mockito*

## Requirements

* Self explanatory names for test methods are used.
* TDD is partially used: Unit tests which prove functionality are present and submitted to github before implementation starts (3 commits per TDD cycle)
* Unit tests cover state testing: direct inputs and outputs (minimum of 3 tests p.p.)
* Unit tests cover: use of mock objects as dummy objects.(minimum of 1 tests p.p.)
* Unit tests cover: use of mock objects for indirect outputs.(minimum of 3 tests p.p.)
* Unit tests cover: use of mock objects for indirect inputs.(minimum of 3 tests p.p.)
* Unit tests cover: verification of direct outputs method calls.(minimum of 3 tests p.p.)
* Unit tests cover: verification of direct inputs method calls.(minimum of 3 tests p.p.)
* Unit tests use Arrange, Act, Assert
* Canvas assignment PD2 is delivered on time

* TDD is used: Tests are written before code is implemented.
* TDD is used: Behaviour of tests is described/listed before tests are written.
* TDD is used: Unit tests which prove functionality are present and submitted to github before implementation starts (3 commits per TDD cycle)
